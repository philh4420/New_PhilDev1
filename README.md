## 🛠 Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_REPO_URL>

# 2. Navigate into the project directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# If the install fails (e.g., due to peer dependency issues with React 19+), use:
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
ℹ️ --legacy-peer-deps is used as a workaround for older packages that haven't updated 
their peer dependencies for React 19 compatibility.

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev

# 5. Open your browser and visit
http://localhost:8080
